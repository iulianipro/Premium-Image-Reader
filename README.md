OCR stands for optical character recognition and is used to convert images, handwritten documents, printed text, and scanned documents into machine-encoded text.
Tesseract is one of the most accurate OCR engines. 
Tesseract allows us to convert any given images into text.

Here I wanna make a simple App that get all the file from a folder and generate de OCR for each images.

Supported are jpg,tiff and Pdf files.

I plan to create a intern image convertor to can use on any kind of images.
